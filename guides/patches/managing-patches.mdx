## Adding a new Patch
To add a new patch, navigate to the `Patches Review` section in the admin panel and click on the "Add" button. This will open a form where you can enter the details of the patch. Alternatively, you can click on the 'add new' link above the patch selection on the Call form.

When creating a new patch you will be asked to provide the following information:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Patch Title (**required**) | Enter the title of the patch. |
| Patch Conductor | Select the conductor for the patch. |
| Orchestration | Enter the orchestration details for the patch. |
| Rough End Date (**required**) | This is the date when the patch is expected to end. It is used to order the patches in the system. Don't worry if it's not accurate, it will be updated later as new calls are added to the patch. |
| Include in Percentage Calculation? | This option allows you to include the patch in the percentage calculation for the orchestra. If checked, the calls in this patch will be included in the percentage calculation for the orchestra. If not checked, the calls in this patch will not be included in the percentage calculation for members. |
| Late Notice Patch? | This option allows you to mark the patch as a late notice patch. If checked, the patch will be marked as a "late notice" patch and, as such, will be excluded from the members' percentage calculation. |

## Creating a Personnel Assignment
To create a personnel assignment for a patch, navigate to the `Patches Admin` section in the admin panel and select the patch you want to assign personnel to from the dropdown menu in the top-right corner.

If this is the first time you are creating a personnel assignment for this patch, you will be prompted to run the patch "wizard" - a step by step process that will guide you through the creation of the personnel assignment. This can be done by clicking on the wand icon in the top-right corner, or on the link beneath the list of call dates.

The wizard will ask you to provide the following information:

### Wizard Step 1: Orchestration and Player counts
The first screen will ask you to enter the orchetsration for the patch as a whole, and the number of players required for each section. This will be used to create the personnel assignment for the patch. Don't worry, it can be updated later if needed.

You can also choose to update the `Include in Percentage Calculation?` and `Late Notice Patch?` options here, if you didn't set them when creating the patch.

Finally, you can choose whether to proceed to the next step (`Create patch`), or to skip the other steps and `Create a blank patch`. 

### Wizard Step 2: Assigning Members
The next step will ask you to assign members to the patch. By default all members will be assigned to the patch, but you can choose from a range of other options for each member. It is important that each member has the correct status set to ensure that their participation in orchestral calls is accurately reflected in the system. The available options are:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Attached to players' list | This option will assign the member to the patch and include them in the players' list. |
| Percentage players | ? |
| On Call | Assign the player as an "on call" player, meaning they are available to be called for the patch. |
| Released | Assign the player as "released", meaning they are not available for the patch. |
| Rotated Off | Assign the player as "rotated off". |
| Sick | Assign the player as "sick", meaning they are not available for the patch. |
| Sabbatical | Assign the player as "on sabbatical", meaning they are not available for the patch. |
| Parental | Assign the player as "on parental leave", meaning they are not available for the patch. |
| Paternity | Assign the player as "on paternity leave", meaning they are not available for the patch. |
| Maternity | Assign the player as "on maternity leave", meaning they are not available for the patch. |
| Late Notice | Assign the player as "late notice", meaning they are unavailable for the patch but will not be included in the percentage calculation, as late notice was given. |
| Other | ? |

Once you have selected the status for each member, click on the "Assign Members" button to proceed to the next step. It may take several seconds to process the assignments.

## Managing Personnel Assignments
After creating running the wizard, you will be taken to the personnel assignment page for the patch. Here you can see the list of players assigned to the patch and their status or seat number for each call.

To begin with you will only see members in the list, however you can now choose to add extras if required. To do this, click on the "add new player to this section" link at the bottom of each section. This will open a dropdown menu where you can select the player you want to add. 

Once you have selected the player they will appear in the list, however they will not yet be saved. To complete the process, click on the `edit` icon at the end of the row of calls next to their name and enter the seat number in the first column. Use the `>>>` link to transfer this seat number to all the other calls. You can change any individual calls should you need to. Once completed, click the `disk` icon at the end of the row to save the changes.
