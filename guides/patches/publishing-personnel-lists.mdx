Administrators with the necessary permissions can choose to take a snapshot of the personnel list at a given point in time and 'publish' it, i.e. make it available for all orchestra members, and extras who are working on the patch, to access within Mobi.

## Publishing
When viewing any patches personnel list, click on the `P` icon in the top right corner of the personnel list display. You will be prompted to confirm that you wish to publish the personnel list.

A snapshot of the personnel list will be taken and saved as a HTML file.

Members and relevant extras will then be able to view this version of the personnel list in the [My Patches](../../players/patches) section.

<Note>
  View the [My Patches](https://www.philharmonia.mobi/patches) section to see the published personnel lists.
