To reset a password, an administrator/super user can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `People > Users` section of the admin panel.
2. Locate the user whose password needs to be reset.
3. Click on the edit icon next to the user's name.
4. Enter a new password for the user.
5. Click `Save` to apply the changes.

You will need to manually email the user with their new password, as the system does not automatically send a notification for password changes. You should advise the user to log in with the new password and change it to something more memorable.
