# Creating a new user
To create a new user, you need to have the appropriate permissions. If you are an administrator, you can add users directly from the admin interface.

**Note:** This guide assumes you have access to the admin interface and the necessary permissions to create users.

## Prerequisites
1. Every user in Mobi must have an associated `Player` record in the database. This is due to historic design decisions that require a player record to be created before a user can be added.
2. If the user is a member of the office staff, you should also ensure that they have a corresponding `Administrator` record in the database.

## Steps to create a new user
1. Once the `Player` record is created, navigate to the `People > Users` interface.
2. Click on the "Add User" button.
3. Fill in the required user details (e.g., username, email, etc.).
4. Select the appropriate `Player` record from the dropdown list. This links the user to their player record.
5. (optional) Select the appropriate `Administrator` record from the dropdown list. This links the user to their administrator record.
6. Assign the appropriate permission level to the user. This determines the default sets of actions they can perform in the system (you can fine tune these later).
7. Assign the user a temporary password. This will be used for their initial login.
7. Click the "Create User" button to save the new user.

## Post-Creation Steps
After creating the user, you may want to:
- **Notify the user**: Send them an email with their login details and instructions on how to access the system.
- **Set up their profile**: Encourage them to log in and complete their profile information.
- **Review permissions**: Ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions for their role. You can adjust these by editing the user record and clicking on the `Edit Permissions` link. For more information on permissions, see the [Permissions Guide](editing-users-permissions).
