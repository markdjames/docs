title: 'Managing user permissions'
description: 'Managing what users can see and do in the system.'
---

Each user has a default set of permissions that determine what they can see and do in the system. This is determined based on their permission level, which is set when the user is created (and can be modified at any time).

However, you can fine-tune these permissions to give users access to specific features or restrict them from certain actions. 

If you want to change a user's permissions, you can do so by editing their user record and clicking on the `Edit Permissions` link. You will then be able to select/deselect any of the following options.
