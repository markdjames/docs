Administrators with the necessary permissions can choose to take a snapshot of the schedule at a given point in time and 'publish' it, i.e. make it available for orchestra members to access within Mobi.

## Publishing
When viewing any schedule month, click on the `P` icon in the top right corner of the schedule display. You will be prompted to confirm that you wish to publish the schedule.

A snapshot of the schedule will be taken and saved as a HTML file.

Members will then be able to view this version of the schedule in the [My Schedules](../../players/schedules) section.

<Note>
  View the [My Schedules](https://www.philharmonia.mobi/schedules) section to see the published schedules.
