This page provides a distribution list of all players who should receive the schedule. It includes contact details such as email addresses and postal addresses.

## Managing the Distribution List
To add or remove players from the distribution list, administrators should edit the players' profiles - on the form there is a checkbox to indicate whether the player should be included in the distribution list.

## Viewing the Distribution List
The distribution list can be viewed in a table format, which includes the following columns:
- **Name**: The full name of the player.
- **Email**: The email address of the player.
- **Member indicator**: Indicates whether the player is a member of the orchestra.

There are also two links at the top of the page:
- **Open Address List**: This link opens a new page with the full address list of all recipients, formatted for printing.
- **View Distribution List Emails**: This link opens a text box containing the email addresses of all recipients, which can be copied and pasted into an email client.
