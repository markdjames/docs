## The Concerts Schedule
The concerts schedule is a tool for managing and viewing all scheduled concerts and rehearsals. It provides a detailed overview of upcoming events, including dates, times, locations, artists and repertoire.

### Overview

The concerts schedule allows users to easily navigate through all scheduled concerts and rehearsals. 

The schedule shows one month at a time, broken down in to weeks, with each row representing a single day, with a column for morning, afternoon, and evening periods.

At the start of each row the first column shows the date and may contain additional information, such as the initials of the stage managers working that day, for example.

Each subsequent column represents a specific time period (morning, afternoon, evening) and displays the scheduled events for that time.

### Adding New Notes & Calls 
To add a new call to the concerts schedule, you can click on the `Edit` icon in the top right corner of any period. This will open the `Schedule Note` form, this is usually the first step in creating a new call, or can just be used to add additional details to the schedule. If there is already an event in a particular period on the schedule, there will be an additional `Edit` icon beneath the other calls which can be used to access this form.
