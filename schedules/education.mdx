## The Education Schedule
The education schedule is a tool for managing and viewing all scheduled education events. It provides a detailed overview of upcoming events, including dates, times, locations, artists and repertoire.

### Overview

The education schedule allows users to easily navigate through all scheduled education events. 

The schedule shows one month at a time, broken down in to weeks, with each row representing a single day, with a column for morning, afternoon, and evening periods.

At the start of each row the first column shows the date and may contain additional information.

Each subsequent column represents a specific time period (morning, afternoon, evening) and displays the scheduled events for that time.

### Adding New Notes & Calls 
To add a new call to the education schedule, you can click on the `Edit` icon in the top right corner of any period. This will open the `Education Schedule Note` form, this is usually the first step in creating a new call, or can just be used to add additional details to the schedule. If there is already an event in a particular period on the schedule, there will be an additional `Edit` icon beneath the other calls which can be used to access this form.
