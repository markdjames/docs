The notice inbox is where you can view and manage all your notices. It allows you to keep track of communications within the orchestra.

## Accessing Your Inbox
To access your notice inbox, click on the **Notices** icon link in the top right corner of the screen. This will take you to your inbox where you can see all your notices.

## Viewing Notices
In your inbox, you will see a list of all your notices. Each notice will display the following information:
- **Sender**: The name of the person who sent the notice.
- **Subject**: The subject of the notice.
- **Date**: The date and time the notice was sent.
- **Status**: Indicates whether the notice has been read or is unread.
You can click on any notice to view its contents. When you open a notice, you will see the full text of the notice.

While viewing a notice, you can also:
- **Archive**: Click the archive button to archive the notice. Archived notices are moved to the archived notices section and will not appear in your main inbox. You can access archived notices by clicking on the "Archived" tab in your inbox.
- **Mark as Unread**: If you want to mark a notice as unread, click the "Mark as Unread" button. This will change the status of the notice back to unread, allowing you to revisit it later.
