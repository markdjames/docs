The message inbox is where you can view and manage all your messages. It allows you to keep track of communications within the orchestra.

## Accessing Your Inbox
To access your message inbox, click on the **Messages** icon link in the top right corner of the screen. This will take you to your inbox where you can see all your messages.

## Viewing Messages
In your inbox, you will see a list of all your messages. Each message will display the following information:
- **Sender**: The name of the person who sent the message.
- **Subject**: The subject of the message.
- **Date**: The date and time the message was sent.
- **Status**: Indicates whether the message has been read or is unread.
You can click on any message to view its contents. When you open a message, you will see the full text of the message.

While viewing a message, you can also:
- **Archive**: Click the archive button to archive the message. Archived messages are moved to the archived messages section and will not appear in your main inbox. You can access archived messages by clicking on the "Archived" tab in your inbox.
- **Mark as Unread**: If you want to mark a message as unread, click the "Mark as Unread" button. This will change the status of the message back to unread, allowing you to revisit it later.
