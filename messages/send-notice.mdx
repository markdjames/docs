Orchestra Members can post notices to all other Mobi users. To access the messaging system, click on the **Notices** icon link in the top right corner. Once in your inbox you will see a button labelled **Post a Notice**. Click this button to open the notice form.

## Posting a Notice
To post a notice, follow these steps:

1. **Enter a Subject**: Provide a clear and concise subject for your notice. 
2. **Compose Your Notice**: Enter the body of your notice. You can format the text using the available formatting options.
3. **Allow Non-members to View**: Check this box if you want to allow non-members to view your notice.
4. **Preview Your Notice**: Clicking the 'Preview Notice' button will show you how your notice will look when sent. This is a good opportunity to check for any errors or formatting issues.
5. **Post Your Notice**: Once you are satisfied with your notice, click the 'Post' button, in the top right corner of the preview screen, to send it to all recipients.

**Note**: The notice will be emailed to all members who have opted in to receive notifications. All members (and extras, if applicable) will receive the notice in their Mobi notices inbox.
