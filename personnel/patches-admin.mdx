The patches admin section provides tools for managing orchestral patchesâ€”groupings of players assigned to specific concerts or events. Admin users can:

- View, create, edit, and delete patches (concert personnel assignments)
- Assign players to patches and manage their participation, including roles and attendance
- Use the Wizard Assign tool to efficiently assign or explain member absences
- Perform bulk operations, such as assigning multiple players or updating details for several events
- Edit and send patch-related messages (draft, confirmed, full) to relevant players
- Customise patch messages for different stages and communicate with players
- View statistics and details about each patch, such as player counts, member percentages, and participation

Access to these features is permission-based and intended for users involved in concert personnel administration. Permissions are granular, allowing for different levels of access (view, edit, delete, publish, etc.) depending on the admin's role.
